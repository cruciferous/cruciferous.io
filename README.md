## cruciferous.io

A collection of productivity and programming tools for the digital citizen.

### What are the planned tools of Cruciferous.io?

Note that none of these are made yet.

- Romanesco
  - A combination to-do list, calendar, planner that plays well with external calendars like Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. This will be the flagship Cruciferous.io tool.
- Savoy
  - A JSON/JS to QMK firmware transpiler and compiler invoker that can import layouts from the Ergodox configurator. Savoy will have one-liners for the base keys (alpha, basic punctuation/symbols, numbers if applicable) of QWERTY, Workman, Plover-QWERTY, Plover-TX, Workman-p, Colemak, Dvorak, QWERTZ, AZERTY, QWERTY-ES, QWERTY-SE, and Charles's personal Workman mod. The community may also PR their own one-liners for other languages or commonly requested english layouts.
- turnip series
  - Javascript functions and constants that Charles (github/turnipjs) wrote and finds useful.
  - turnipJS
    - Javascript that is useful in the front end or back end (like string or array manipulation).
  - turnipGreens
    - Front end only javascript bits (like common patterns for listeners)
  - turnipRoot
    - Back end only javascript bits (like common middlewares) for both Node and Deno.
- Brussels
  - CSS-only web components. Think along the lines of a custom animated checkbox that only uses CSS.
- Others in the future.
